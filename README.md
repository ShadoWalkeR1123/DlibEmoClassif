# DlibEmoClassif
Using Dlib to mark facelandmarks and feed those images into an ensemble model.

There will be two files, one will be used to generate dlib to generate facelandmarks and plot those into google drive.
These images will then be fed into an ensemble model used to classify emotions.

First attempt on trying to incorporate Dlib for emotion classification.
